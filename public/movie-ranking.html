<h1> The Best Movies according to Vikas</h1>
<h2> My top three movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3> The Prestige</h3>
<p>This is my favourite movie. It's really complicated and has a great plot. It keeps the audience on the edge of thier seats all the time.</p>
<h3>Guardians of Galaxy - Vol 1</h3>
<p>This the best Marvel movie according to me. The humour element of this movie is simply outstanding. Great entertainment.</p>
<h3>True Lies</h3>
<p>If you are looking for wholesome entertainment, then this is the one. It has everything from action to emotion to comedy....One of the best movies ever made.</p>
